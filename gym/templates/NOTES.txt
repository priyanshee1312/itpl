=== How to Use This Helm Chart ===

1. Helm Chart Structure:
   - Ensure you have a Helm chart directory structure set up.

2. Configure Values:
   - Edit the values.yaml file to define parameters for your Ingress resource:
     - `ingress.host`: Define the hostname for your Ingress. (e.g., [gymie.com])
     - `ingress.path`: Define the path for your Ingress.
     - `service.name`: Define the name of the service to route traffic to.
     - `service.port`: Define the port of the service to route traffic to.

3. Create or Edit the Ingress Template:
   - Navigate to the templates directory.
   - Edit or create a YAML file (e.g., ingress.yaml) to define your Ingress resource.

4. Ingress Template Example:
   - Refer to the ingress.yaml file for an example template.
   - Customize values using Helm templating syntax, such as .Release.Name and .Values.

5. Install or Upgrade the Helm Chart:
   - Use the 'helm install' or 'helm upgrade' command to deploy your Helm chart.
   - Example:
     helm install <release-name> <path-to-chart> <name-space>

6. Verify Installation:
   - Check your Kubernetes cluster for the deployed Ingress resource.
   - Ensure that your Ingress controller is running to handle Ingress resources.
   - Example:
     kubectl get pods <name-space>
     kubectl get svc <name-space>
     kubectl get ing <name-space>

=== Important Notes ===

- Make sure your Kubernetes cluster has an Ingress controller installed and configured properly.
- Validate your Ingress configuration to ensure proper routing of traffic.
- Refer to the official Helm documentation for more advanced usage and troubleshooting.
- Make sure when ever you are changing the host name then also change the name of host in NOTES.txt.

Happy Helm Chart Deployment! :-)
